## Puzzle e4s-g2-00

Classic Sudoku on a 9x9 grid. Fill every cell with a digit 1-9 so that each row, each column and each 3x3 box contains every digit exactly once.

Grid ('.' = empty):
. . 5 | . . . | . 7 8
. 6 . | . 4 5 | . . .
2 9 . | 8 . . | 4 . .
---------------------
. 3 . | . 7 . | . . 4
. . 1 | . 5 . | . 8 .
. . 2 | 9 . . | . . .
---------------------
7 . . | . . 9 | . 6 .
. 2 . | 3 . . | 1 . .
. . . | 7 . . | 2 9 .

Answer format for this puzzle: {"grid": ["<row 1 digits>", "<row 2 digits>", ...]} -- each row as a string of digits, no separators.
